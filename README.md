## Hello! I'm taking a specialization course in Data Science and I'm loving it! I'm loving it so much that I'm trying migrate from my current job to this area. I am going to share every step of the way I'm going through, probably you won't see the best solutions all the time and the best programming either, but definitely you will see some improvement and harder challenges in every level we advance.
## This repository contains several works from my specialization course done in a group of colleagues. You will find statistical exercises, introduction to AI and some machine learning examples.
